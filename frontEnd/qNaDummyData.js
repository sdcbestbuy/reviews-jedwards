    Question:'What does the remote look like? Does it have numbers, or the round circular thing?',
    Answer:'It has numbers, however if you want to flip through the channels you\'re gonna be disappointed! Every time you channel up/down you get a TvPlus channel this making it where you have to enter each channel every time you want to see what else is on, I hate this and may return for this reason'

    Question:'Can this TV be Wall Mounted with a full motion TV wall mount bracket? I\'ve seen where someone mentioned that it does NOT have threaded holes on the back for a wall mount bracket?',
    Answer:'Yes, I just did this. TV does not come with any mounting hardware (screws). The four mounting holes on the back are threaded. The manual tells you what size screws you will need (M8-1.25 20mm), and make sure the screws are flat on the end not tapered. Screws can be found at local hardware store, got mine at one of the big box stores.'

    Question:'Can you add Apps? Like direct tv app?',
